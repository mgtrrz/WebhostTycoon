# WebhostTycoon

WebhostTycoon is a work-in-progress Unity3D game designed to simulate owning a Webhosting business.

This is my first game and I'm keeping the scope relatively small. It's still very far away from being complete but some of the engine is there.
If the concept becomes interesting and fun, I may release it on Steam and iOS/Android. Otherwise, it's more of a learning experience and a potential to release more games.

## Features?

* Provision, setup, and maintain servers holding customer websites.
* Hire staff to maintain the servers, provide customer service, research new technologies to sell or automate, and market your company.
* Fight problem customers, fraud, and DDOS attacks all while taking on new customers and being the largest Webhost in the world.

## When?

God who knows. I work full time and am only able to do this on my freetime. 

## Art?

I have no experience

## Thanks

Thanks to all my friends and family that help support the things I do. Without them, I'd probably still do those things but it would be harder.
